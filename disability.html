		<a name="blindness"><h3>Blindness</h3></a>
		<p>
		There is a multitude of technology available to make websites abundantly accessible to those who are blind.
		However, that technology is only as useful as the website's design is accessible to that technology. In other 
		words, the technology available to the blind can only take advantage of a website insomuch as the website's developers
		have designed the site with these technologies in mind. One of the main ways that the blind uses the internet is by 
		using screen readers. A screen reader is a piece of software that "reads" what's on the screen and interfaces with 
		either a speech synthysizer or a braille display. For a website to be conducive to this method of accessibility, 
		the website needs to be designed such that the first things that appear when the user presses "tab" are the navigation
		or "skip navigation" buttons. <br>

			<a name="perceivable"><h3>Perceivable</h3></a>
			<p>
			I've made my site perceivable by adding alt text to every image. I've also made it so that on each page,
			as soon as you navigate to it, if you press "tab", buttons will come out from the left side, allowing 
			users with both visual and dexterity impairments to more effectively use the site.
			</p>
			
			<a name="operable"><h3>Operable</h3></a>
			<p>
			As mentioned above, my site is operable regardless of disability because of the skip navigation I've 
			implemented on each page through use of the tab key.
			</p>
			
			<a name="understandable"><h3>Understandable</h3></a>
			<p>
			My main goal, in adjusting this site to be more accessible to users
			with disabilities, was to leave its usability for typical users largely
			unchanged. With the way I implemented skip navigation, I feel that I achieved
			that goal.
			</p>
			
			<a name="robust"><h3>Robust</h3></a>
			<p>
			I have not specifically designed this site to be "robust", according to the 
			given definition. However, I have run the code through 
			HTML and CSS validation software and have not seen any errors that would 
			suggest that the code is not compatible with certain browsers.
