		<h3>Photography:</h3>
			<p><i>My photography began in the summer of 2012 as a single-minded mission:
			to capture God's glory through the beauty of His creation. Living close to the country 
			at the time, it struck me that many people see the country as boring, flat farmland as 
			far as the eye can see. But our world is filled with amazing things to see, each and 
			every bit of which was crafted by Him. Even in the ordinary, God's love shines. I realized
			that there are many things that people drive past every day and begin to take for granted.
			I wanted to work to find these things and capture them in a way that would draw the beauty
			out of them. Below are three of my most cherished photos.</i></p>

They flow constantly, changing the landscape ever more through the course of time. This photo takes the sense of the age of the waterfall and juxtaposes with the ever-changing nature of light. Water sees its work come to fruition over many thousands of years, but light can change in the blink of an eye. And yet, they were both created on the very first day of creation. In creation, we find a sense of poetry. This is what I tried to capture." /></td>

						<td><i>This photo evokes feelings of turmoil, angst, and confusion. The tumultuous sky is analogous to feelings we experience when something entirely new and unexplored is set before us. So often, we see the path before us and, though clear, appears to have the potential for turmoil and angst. It is at these times we must remember Jesus’s words when he speaks of faith in the face of difficulties (Matt. 6:24-34). Upon hearing these words, it becomes clear - the path must be tread, despite the difficulties, in order to grow in hope, love, and faith in the truth of Christ.</i></td>

						<td><i>“Do not lay up for yourselves treasures here on earth, where moth and rust consume...For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” The barn rusts as its owner takes Jesus’ words to heart. He decides to store his treasures in heaven. In doing so, his heart is moved. Now, we see the new grass and trees overtake his old treasure. In this photo, we see also the sunlight as it permeates the leaves of the tree, as though a sign of the way Jesus’ words permeate the man’s heart and soul, just as they permeate our own.</i></td>
